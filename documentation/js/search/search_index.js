that implements the Intersection Observer API. It emits an event each\ntime the host element intersects with the viewport.\nUsage\nTo use the IntersectionObserverDirective, add the vlhIntersectionObserver attribute to an element in your template.\nBind a method to the (intersection) output event to handle the intersection event.\nHere's an example:\nExample :\nExponentiallyBackoff Function\nExponentiallyBackoff is a function that implements exponential backoff in observables.\nUsage\nThis function takes four parameters:\n\nmaxRetryAttempts: The maximum number of retry attempts. Default is 3.\ninitialDelay: The initial delay in milliseconds before the first retry. Default is 1000.\nmaxDelay: The maximum delay in milliseconds between retries. Default is 2 minutes.\ndisableAndUseConstantDelayOf: If provided, disables exponential backoff and uses this constant delay instead.\n\nIt returns a function that takes an Observable and returns an Observable with retry logic applied.\nHere's an example:\nExample :ExponentiallyBackoff(10, 1000, 2 * 60 * 1000, 5000);TimeoutBackoff Function\nTimeoutBackoff is a function that implements timeout backoff in observables.\nUsage\nThis function takes three parameters:\n\nmaxRetryAttempts: The maximum number of retry attempts. Default is 3.\ninitialDelay: The initial delay in milliseconds before the first retry. Default is 1000.\nmaxDelay: The maximum delay in milliseconds between retries. Default is 2 minutes.\n\nIt returns a function that takes an Observable and returns an Observable with retry logic applied.\nHere's an example:\nExample :TimeoutBackoff(10, 1000, 2 * 60 * 1000);Service worker classes\n\nCustomEventWorker A class that helps create and listen to custom events.\nPollingWorker A class that helps create and manage polling tasks.\nServerSentEventWorker A class that helps listen to server-sent events.\nStoreWorker A class that helps manage data flow using the Redux pattern.\nSubscriptionWorker A class that helps manage subscriptions to observables.\nWebsocketWorker A class that helps send/read messages to/from a websocket connections.\n\nUsage\nWhen bootstrapping each class, it is best to use the provided PROVIDER_FACTORY helpers.\nCustomEventWorker\nExample :const workerInjectionToken = new InjectionToken>('worker');\nproviders: [\n  CUSTOM_EVENT_PROVIDER_FACTORY(workerInjectionToken)\n]Example :const
